# blindtest-spotify

This is a simple demo of how to create a blindtest using Spotify and React.
This app was created during a WebDojo organized by Theodo. Theodo provided the app structure and a tutorial.  

The app is available online at 
```bash
https://valsworthen.github.io/blindtest-spotify
```

However, **since Spotify API keys expire after one hour** the blindtest won't work, unless you provide a new key in App.js  

## Getting started

First, fork / clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clement-escolano/blindtest-spotify.git
cd blindtest-spotify
```

Then, install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install # or alternatively: yarn install
```

To launch the app in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

To deploy the app to Github pages, modify the `homepage` key in `package.json` to match your account and project.
Then, launch the command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
